# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict customer satisfaction levels using machine learning models. The workflow includes data exploration (EDA), preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to understand factors influencing customer sentiment and to make accurate predictions.

## Project Structure

- `1_EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset.
- `2_Modeling.ipynb`: Model development and performance evaluation.
- 
## Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DRdLKOinSNuoMwVyFGH86f3xEhkZMrz6/view

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover trends and anomalies
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training multiple ML models to predict customer satisfaction
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy and F1 score

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `1_EDA.ipynb` and run the cells for EDA.
3. Then run `2_Modeling.ipynb` to train and evaluate models.

## Results

- Best model: Random Forest with 85% accuracy
- Important features: Service quality, response time, and issue resolution
